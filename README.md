## 🚧 Projects (Where I Learn by Building)

Most of my projects come from a mix of curiosity, YouTube tutorials, debugging chaos, and a lot of Googling.  
I don’t just follow tutorials — I tweak things, break them, fix them, and in the process, actually learn how it works.

Here are a few highlights:

- 💬 **Real-Time Chat App**  
  A full-stack app using React, Node.js, and Socket.io. Learned about sockets, async flows, and basic deployment.

- 🌐 **Frontend Experiments**  
  Small UI/UX projects using HTML, CSS, and Tailwind. Mostly built from scratch or tweaked from online inspirations.

- ⚙️ **Template-based Builds**  
  Projects where I started with a tutorial base but added my own features, designs, or logic to make it mine.

- 🚀 **In Progress:** Portfolio Website  
  Working on building my own portfolio site to showcase projects better and maybe even blog my dev journey.

Every project teaches me something — and I’m proud of how far I’ve come by just showing up and building consistently.
